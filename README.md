# Bootstrap
Recreating a simple and basic web page with Bootstrap
In this exercise, I decided to recreate again the first Assignment of module 1. Web using _html-Css-

Concluding that
Bootstrap is great for   built  quick simple design templates and responsive, 
has great reusable elemets like the carousel, buttons, navbar, cards etc.
however it makes the task a bit complicated to try to create your own styles, doing therefore the design becomes unoriginal.
