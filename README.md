# Bootstrap
Recreating a simple and basic web page.
In this exercise, I decided to recreate again the first Assignment of module 1. Web using _html-Css- and implement with Bootstrap. 

Concluding that
Bootstrap is great for   built  quick simple design templates and responsive, 
has great reusable elemets like the carousel, buttons, navbar, cards etc.
however it makes the task a bit complicated to try to create your own styles, doing therefore the design becomes unoriginal.
